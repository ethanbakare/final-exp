# Receipt Scanner Project

## Overview

The Receipt Scanner project is a Next.js-based frontend module within the final-exp monorepo that integrates with the standalone receipt-scanner-api backend. This project allows users to upload receipt images, which are then processed using OCR and AI to extract structured data including store information, items, prices, and totals.

### Components:

1. **Frontend (final-exp monorepo)**
   - React components for uploading and displaying receipts
   - Custom hooks for API communication
   - TypeScript types for data structures

2. **API Proxy (Next.js API Routes)**
   - Forwards requests to the FastAPI backend
   - Handles file uploads and form data

3. **Backend (receipt-scanner-api)**
   - OCR processing using Google Cloud Vision
   - AI-powered data extraction using GPT-4o-mini
   - Data validation and cleaning

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Steps

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created directory structure following monorepo conventions
   - Set up package.json with correct namespace (@master-exp/receipt-scanner)
   - Created TypeScript configuration

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Defined comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for receipt data
   - Created types for API responses and validation structures

3. **API Integration**
   - Implemented useReceiptScanner hook for API communication
   - Set up Next.js API route to proxy requests to the FastAPI backend

4. **Component Scaffolding**
   - Created ReceiptUploader component for file uploads
   - Implemented ReceiptDisplay component for showing processed data
   - Built main page structure in pages/receipt-scanner/index.tsx

### Pending Steps

1. **UI Design Implementation**
   - Apply final design to components
   - Implement responsive layout
   - Add animations and transitions

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add validation for file types and sizes

3. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add receipt history
   - Implement receipt editing
   - Add export functionality

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add end-to-end testing

## Technical Details

### File Types Supported

The receipt scanner currently supports the following image formats:
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- BMP

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/receipt-scanner/process` | POST | Proxy endpoint that forwards requests to the FastAPI backend |

### Data Flow

1. User uploads a receipt image through the ReceiptUploader component
2. The image is sent to the Next.js API route
3. The API route forwards the request to the FastAPI backend
4. The backend processes the image using OCR and AI
5. Structured data is returned to the frontend
6. The ReceiptDisplay component renders the processed data

## Dependencies

- axios: For API requests
- react-dropzone: For file upload functionality
- react-hook-form: For form handling

## Project Location

- Frontend: `/Users/ethan/Documents/projects/final-exp/src/projects/receipt-scanner`
- Backend: `/Users/ethan/Documents/projects/receipt-scanner-api`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- The final-exp monorepo must be set up and running
- The receipt-scanner-api backend must be running on http://localhost:8000

### Running the Project

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ethan/Documents/projects/receipt-scanner-api
   python run.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ethan/Documents/projects/final-exp
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the receipt scanner at http://localhost:3000/receipt-scanner

## Next Steps

1. Complete the UI design implementation
2. Connect components to the designed interface
3. Implement remaining features
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Deploy to production

## Notes for Future Development

- Consider adding support for more file types
- Explore options for offline processing
- Investigate integration with accounting software
- Add multi-language support for receipts
