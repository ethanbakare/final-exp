# ListItem Editable Title Focus Issues

## Problem Description
When clicking outside the ListItem card, particularly when clicking rapidly or at certain positions on the page, the editable title incorrectly receives focus. This issue persists across desktop and mobile devices despite multiple attempted solutions.

The editable title should only receive focus when explicitly clicked on, but it sometimes becomes focused unexpectedly through event propagation issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Event propagation issues between nested React components
- React's synthetic event system conflicts with native browser events
- Race conditions between focus/blur events and click handlers
- Issues with className handling when used with CSS modules

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Event Delegation with Card Click Handler
```javascript
const handleCardClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  // Check if click target is not the editable element
  const editableEl = titleContentRef.current;
  if (editableEl && !editableEl.contains(e.target as Node)) {
    // If currently focused, blur it
    if (isTitleFocused) {
      editableEl.blur();
    }
    // Prevent any focus if clicking elsewhere
    e.preventDefault();
  }
};
```
**Result**: Partially fixed the issue but created a "jitter" effect where the title briefly becomes editable before reverting.

### 2. DOM Isolation with Pointer Events CSS
```css
.card > *:not(.store-with-date) {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
.store-with-date > *:not(.store-name) {
  pointer-events: none;
}
.store-name {
  pointer-events: none;
}
.editable-title {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```
**Result**: Broke existing functionality and didn't fully address the issue.

### 3. Modal-like Focus Management
```javascript
const [isEditMode, setIsEditMode] = useState(false);

// Toggle edit mode
const enableEditMode = () => {
  setIsEditMode(true);
  document.body.classList.add('editing-receipt-title');
};

// When done editing
const disableEditMode = () => {
  setIsEditMode(false);
  document.body.classList.remove('editing-receipt-title');
};
```
**Result**: Added complexity without resolving the issue.

### 4. Component Restructuring with Isolation
```javascript
// Separate EditableTitle component
const EditableTitle: React.FC<{
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
}> = ({ value, onChange }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```
**Result**: Completely broke the functionality of editing the title.

### 5. Safe className Handling with String Conversion
```javascript
const handleCardInteractions = (e: React.MouseEvent | React.TouchEvent) => {
  const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
  const classNameStr = typeof target.className === 'string' 
    ? target.className 
    : String(target.className);
  
  if ((classNameStr.indexOf('card') >= 0 && classNameStr.indexOf('editable') === -1) || 
      classNameStr.indexOf('card-header') >= 0 || 
      classNameStr.indexOf('store-with-date') >= 0) {
    // Handler implementation
  }
};
```
**Result**: Fixed runtime errors but didn't fully resolve the focus issue.

### 6. Mobile Touch Event Handling
```javascript
<div 
  className={`card ${styles.container} ${className}`}
  onMouseDown={handleCardInteractions}
  onTouchStart={handleCardInteractions}
  onTouchEnd={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
>
```
**Result**: Improved mobile behavior but clicking rapidly outside still triggers issues.

## Current Implementation
The component currently uses a combination of approaches #5 and #6, which addresses most common cases and prevents runtime errors, but still exhibits the focus bug in edge cases.

The core issue remains: unexpected focus of the editable title when clicking rapidly or at specific positions on the page, particularly at the boundaries of elements.

## Remaining Issues
- Rapid clicking outside the card can still trigger the editable title
- Difficult to reproduce consistently but happens occasionally
- May be related to event bubbling in the browser or React's event system

## Future Investigation Paths
- Explore using capture phase event listeners to intercept focus events early
- Implement a global click handler at document level with focus tracking
- Investigate timing issues in event handling
- Test with different React versions to identify framework-specific issues
- Consider redesigning the component to use controlled input instead of contentEditable
- Explore browser inconsistencies that might be contributing to the issue
