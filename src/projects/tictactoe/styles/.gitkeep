# Styles Directory - LEAN APPROACH

This directory contains consolidated styling for the Tic-Tac-Toe Arena:

- `arena.module.css` - Single CSS module with organized sections:
  • Colors & fonts (CSS variables)
  • Game arena layout (header + commentary)  
  • Game board styling (3x3 grid + cells)
  • Animations (fade in/out, move decay)
  • Responsive design (mobile/desktop)

This approach consolidates 4 separate CSS files into 1 organized module.
