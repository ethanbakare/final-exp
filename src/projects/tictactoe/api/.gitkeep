# API Directory - LEAN APPROACH

This directory contains consolidated Next.js API routes for the Tic-Tac-Toe Arena:

- `arena.ts` - Single endpoint handling all AI orchestration:
  • Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 model switching
  • Game state formatting and prompt generation
  • Response parsing and validation
  • Error handling and retry logic
  • Real-time streaming (if needed)

This approach consolidates 3 separate API routes into 1 comprehensive endpoint.
