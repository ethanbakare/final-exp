# Components Directory - LEAN APPROACH

This directory contains consolidated React components for the Tic-Tac-Toe Arena:

- `GameArena.tsx` - Main container component including:
  • Player header (Claude vs GPT-4)
  • Real-time commentary panel
  • Game controller logic
  • Overall layout and styling

- `GameBoard.tsx` - Pure 3x3 grid component:
  • Cell rendering and animations
  • Move display and decay effects
  • Click handling (if needed for debugging)

This approach consolidates 4 separate components into 2 focused components.
