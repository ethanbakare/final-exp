# Hooks Directory - LEAN APPROACH

This directory contains consolidated custom React hooks for the Tic-Tac-Toe Arena:

- `useGameState.ts` - Single hook managing all game logic:
  • Board state and move tracking
  • Move validation and win detection
  • AI turn orchestration and API calls
  • Move decay system (FIFO with 7-turn limit)
  • Animation state and timing
  • Error handling and recovery

This approach consolidates 4 separate hooks into 1 comprehensive hook.
