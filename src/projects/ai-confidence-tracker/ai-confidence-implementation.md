TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
Speech Confidence Visualizer with DeepGram Integration
1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The Speech Confidence Visualizer is a web application that demonstrates AI speech recognition confidence at the word level. Using DeepGram's advanced speech-to-text API with word-level confidence scoring, the system:

Provides reference sentences for users to read aloud
Records user speech via browser microphone
Processes speech through DeepGram's API
Visualizes the transcription with confidence indicators for each word
Summarizes low-confidence words for further attention

This specification details the technical implementation approach with particular focus on the DeepGram integration and confidence visualization.
2. DEEPGRAM INTEGRATION
2.1 API Selection & Requirements
DeepGram is selected for this implementation because:

It provides word-level confidence scores (word_confidence parameter)
It offers high-speed transcription with low latency
It supports high-quality language models (Nova-2)

2.2 Required API Parameters
// DeepGram API Required Parameters
{
  model: "nova-2",           // Latest model for best accuracy
  language: "en-US",         // English language model
  word_confidence: true,     // Critical - enables per-word confidence scores
  punctuate: true,           // Adds proper punctuation
  diarize: false,            // Single speaker, no need for speaker separation
  utterances: false,         // Not needed for our use case
  alternatives: 1            // Only need the top transcription
}
2.3 Expected Response Structure
DeepGram returns a structured response containing word-level details:
// Simplified response structure - focusing on the parts we need
{
  "results": {
    "channels": [{
      "alternatives": [{
        "transcript": "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog",
        "confidence": 0.92,   // Overall confidence
        "words": [
          {
            "word": "the",
            "start": 0.01,    // Timestamp in seconds
            "end": 0.15,      // Timestamp in seconds
            "confidence": 0.99  // Word-level confidence score
          },
          // Additional words with their confidence scores...
        ]
      }]
    }]
  }
}

4. FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 Audio Recording Module
The audio recording module will:

Request microphone permissions
Create an AudioContext and MediaRecorder
Capture audio stream in chunks
Combine chunks and encode for transmission
Provide visual feedback during recording
Handle recording start/stop controls

Pseudocode:
function initializeAudioRecording():
    requestMicrophonePermission()
    if permission granted:
        create AudioContext
        create MediaRecorder
        setup audioChunks array
        
        on data available:
            add chunk to audioChunks
            
        on recording stop:
            combine audioChunks into audioBlob
            convert to base64
            send to processing function
    else:
        show permission error
4.2 Reference Text Component
Based on the UI designs, this component:

Displays the current reference sentence
Provides navigation between multiple sentences
Shows pagination indicators
Includes "Try another sentence" functionality

Pseudocode:
function ReferenceSentenceComponent():
    initialize sentencesList with predefined sentences
    initialize currentIndex to 0
    
    render:
        heading "Read text below aloud"
        current sentence text
        pagination dots based on sentencesList length
        "Try another sentence" button
        
    on "Try another sentence" click:
        increment currentIndex (loop if at end)
        update displayed sentence
4.3 Confidence Visualization Component
This critical component will:

Render the transcribed text
Apply visual indicators (colors/underlines) based on confidence
Show confidence percentages on interaction
Generate and display low-confidence word summary

The visualization will use these confidence thresholds:

High confidence (>90%): No highlighting or subtle green
Medium confidence (70-90%): Orange/yellow highlighting
Low confidence (<70%): Red highlighting/underlining

Pseudocode:
function ConfidenceVisualizerComponent(transcriptionData):
    parse words array from transcriptionData
    
    for each word in words:
        determine confidence category (high/medium/low)
        apply appropriate CSS class and style
        
    identify lowConfidenceWords (words with confidence < 70%)
    
    render:
        transcribed text with styled word spans
        if lowConfidenceWords exists:
            render low confidence summary section
            display word chips for each low confidence word
5. BACKEND PROCESSING
5.1 Audio Processing Endpoint
A serverless function will:

Receive the base64-encoded audio
Convert to the appropriate format for DeepGram
Call DeepGram API with required parameters
Process and return the results

Pseudocode:
function handleAudioProcessing(request):
    extract audioData from request
    decode base64 to binary
    
    configure DeepGramParameters with word_confidence=true
    
    try:
        response = callDeepGramAPI(audioData, DeepGramParameters)
        extract transcript and words from response
        return formatted results
    catch:
        handle and return appropriate error
5.2 DeepGram API Integration
The backend will communicate with DeepGram through their official API:
Pseudocode:
function callDeepGramAPI(audioData, parameters):
    set headers with API key and content type
    
    send POST request to "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
    with parameters:
        - word_confidence=true
        - model=nova-2
        - language=en-US
        - punctuate=true
    
    return response.json()
6. CONFIDENCE VISUALIZATION LOGIC
6.1 Confidence Classification
The system will classify word confidence into three categories:
function classifyConfidence(score):
    if score >= 0.9:
        return "high"    // No highlight or subtle green
    else if score >= 0.7:
        return "medium"  // Orange/yellow highlight
    else:
        return "low"     // Red highlight/underline
6.2 Visualization Implementation
Based on the UI designs, the visualization will include:

In-line Word Styling:

Apply appropriate styling (color/underline) to each word based on confidence
Optionally show confidence percentage on hover/interaction


Word Chips Summary:

Generate chips/pills for each low or medium confidence word
Use consistent color coding with in-line visualization
Show exact confidence percentage on interaction


Confidence Legend:

Display a legend explaining the color coding system
Include in the UI for first-time users



Pseudocode:
function renderConfidenceVisualization(words):
    // Render main transcription with confidence styling
    create container element
    
    for each word in words:
        confidenceClass = classifyConfidence(word.confidence)
        create span element
        add word text to span
        apply CSS class based on confidenceClass
        add to container
    
    // Generate low confidence summary
    lowConfidenceWords = filter words where confidence < 0.7
    
    if lowConfidenceWords is not empty:
        create lowConfidenceSummary element
        for each word in lowConfidenceWords:
            create wordChip element
            add word text
            apply confidence-based styling
            add percentage tooltip
            add to lowConfidenceSummary
            
    return container and lowConfidenceSummary
